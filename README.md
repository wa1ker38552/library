# library
my own library for js as well as css components

Basically hate js frameworks so i use vanilla, these functions just make doing stuff easier. I am only using Github pages to host these files so I can acess them within my own projects. Also i'm used to writing in python so some of these js functions are directly translated from python with the exact same syntax<br>
